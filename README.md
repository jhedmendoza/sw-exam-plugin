# Challenge-2: WordPress Plugin Challenge
## Notes
- This plugin will create a table `sw_items` upon first activation.
- Items can be added on the page SW Admin Settings Page.
- Items can be reordered by dragging the elements.
- An item can be deleted by clicking the trash icon located on the right side of the item.
- The `[mylistdemo]` shortcode can be used to display list items on the frontend. A `sort` attribute can be passed to the shortcode with the values `ASC` or `DESC`. If no attribute is passed, the `ASC` order will be used by default.
